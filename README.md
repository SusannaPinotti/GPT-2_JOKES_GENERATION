# GPT-2_JOKES_GENERATION

This repository was created to store all the relevant material used in the final project for the NLP course taught by professor Fabio Tamburini at Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge in Bologna. The project is an experiment with fine tuning GPT-2 to produce humorous language. The repository hosts: 
- All the Colab Notebooks (Exploratory analysis, Fine tuning, Analysis of generated dataset)
- The datasets (Training and Generated)
- A simple website hosting a visualization of the two topic modelling analysis performed on the training dataset and on the generated dataset, at this URL: https://susannapinotti.github.io/GPT-2_JOKES_GENERATION/index.html
